Thorfinn is a young and determined warrior with a thirst for vengeance, driven by the desire to avenge his father's death at the hands of Askeladd, a cunning and ruthless Viking leader. Inspired by the Norse sagas and legends, Thorfinn sets out on a perilous journey across the Viking world, seeking to prove his strength and honor as a warrior.

Vinland Saga is a gripping tale set in a world of war, politics, and adventure. The story unfolds against the backdrop of the Viking Age, a time of fierce battles, epic voyages, and larger-than-life characters. As Thorfinn navigates through the complexities of Viking society, he encounters allies and foes alike, each with their own ambitions and agendas.

The plot begins with Thorfinn's childhood, growing up among the warriors of his father's band. His father, Thors, was a legendary warrior known for his skill and honor.
